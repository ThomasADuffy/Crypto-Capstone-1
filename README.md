## **Introduction**
Cryptocurrency is currently a phenomenon that has taken social media and wall street by storm. It
came from being an unknown digital token based off of an ingenious math equation to becoming a way
for the average person to make millions of dollars without even knowing the functionality of it. The
purpose of this capstone is finding out the reason on why this wealth and dramatic increase of price
happened in the cryptocurrency market by analyzing relevant data. First we must look at the what creates
the value of a currency; normally the value of a currency is relative to the health of the country/s which it
comes from or used(i.e the USD($) value is based of the economic health of the U.S.A). For
cryptocurrency though the value can not be based off of a country due to its decentralized nature, so
therefor what makes this value? Though I do believe there is inherent value in cryptocurrency, my
hypothesis is the value has been socially constructed and does not represent its true value.


## **What's the data?**
In the data I have collected I will be looking for a correlation between social media(focusing on twitter data)
mentions/metrics and the price/volume of two cryptocurrencies. I will be focusing on Bitcoin and
Ethereum as those are the two coins I have collected sufficient data for proper analysis.
I'm using two Datasets. One data set contained raw json file data for all of the prices of all cryptocurrencies but in order to work with my twitter data set, I will only be using the Ethereum and Bitcion json files for financial data.
